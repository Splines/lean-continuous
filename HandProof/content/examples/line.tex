\subsection{Functions $x \mapsto mx + y_0$ are continuous}

\begin{theorem}
   Let $f: \R \to \R$ be a function given by $f(x) \coloneqq m \cdot x + y_0$, where $m, y_0 \in \R$. Then $f$ is continuous at every point $a \in \R$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
   Let $a \in \R$ be an arbitrary point where we want to show that $f: \R \to \R, \: x \mapsto m\cdot x + y_0$ is continuous.

   We first consider the simpler case where the slope is $0$, that is $\mathbf{m = 0}$. Then our function is given by $f(x) = y_0$ for all $x \in \R$. This is a constant function and we have already shown that constant functions are continuous. Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $a$ when $m = 0$.

   Now to the more interesting case where $\mathbf{m \neq 0}$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$. We choose $\delta \coloneqq \frac{\varepsilon}{|m|}$. Since $\epsilon > 0$ and $|m| > 0$, we have $\delta > 0$.

   Let $x \in \R$ and $|x-a| < \delta$. Then:
   \begin{align*}
      |f(x) - f(a)| &= \bigl|(m \cdot x + y_0) - (m \cdot a - y_0)\bigr| \\
      &= |m \cdot x - m \cdot a| \\
      &= |m \cdot (x - a)| \\
      &= |m| \cdot |x - a| \\
      &< |m| \cdot \delta
      = |m| \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{|m|} = \varepsilon
   \end{align*}
   In the last line, we have used the fact that $|x - a| < \delta$ and then used our definition of $\delta$.

   The argument shows that $|f(x) - f(a)| < \varepsilon$, which proves the continuity of $f$ at $a$.
\end{proof}
