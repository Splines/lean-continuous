\subsection{The constant function is continuous}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $f: \R \to \R$ be a function given by $f(x) \coloneqq c$, where $c \in \R$. That is, $f$ is a constant function. Then $f$ is continuous at every point $a \in \R$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $a \in \R$ be an arbitrary point where we want to show that $f: \R \to \R, \: x \mapsto c$ is continuous. Let $\varepsilon > 0$. We choose $\delta \coloneqq 1 > 0$. Let $x \in \R$. Then:
    \[
        |f(x) - f(a)| = |c - c| = |0| = 0 < \varepsilon
    \]
    With that, the implication also holds true since its conclusion is always true (as shown above) irregardless of the premise.
    \[
        |x - a| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(a)| = 0 < \varepsilon
    \]
    Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $a$.
\end{proof}
